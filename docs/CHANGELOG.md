## Release v0.4.0

We're so excited to release Just the Docs `v0.4.0`. This release has been almost a year in the making - after our new maintenance team has taken over the project, we've added two years of backlogged features and bugfixes to modernize the theme. This CHANGELOG will summarize some of the key changes, discuss migrations strategies, and outline broad future plans for this theme.

### Brief Overview - Highlighted Changes

`v0.4.0` contains many new features and bugfixes. We enumerate all of them in further sections in this changelog; however, we'd like to call out some of the most-requested changes:

- better support for dark theme: dark highlighting, search input color
- [callouts](https://just-the-docs.com/docs/ui-components/callouts/), a new design component to highlight content
- [configuring mermaid.js](https://just-the-docs.com/docs/ui-components/code/#mermaid-diagram-code-blocks), a markdown-native diagram visualization library
- [copy code button](https://just-the-docs.com/docs/ui-components/code/#copy-button) for code snippets
- external navigation links
- major improvements to nav generation efficiency and robustness
- minor improvements to built-in accessibility (SVG icons, nav titles, skip to main content)
- [modularized site components](https://just-the-docs.com/docs/customization/#custom-layouts-and-includes) (advanced feature)
- [new custom includes](https://just-the-docs.com/docs/customization/#override-includes): table of contents heading, navigation panel footer, search placeholder, lunr search indices
- bugfixes involving WEBrick and Ruby 3, Liquid processing in CSS comments, nested task lists, relative URLs, scroll navigation, corrupted search data from rake, breadcrumbs, and more!
- more documentation for [custom includes](https://just-the-docs.com/docs/customization/#override-includes), this changelog, and the [migration guide](https://just-the-docs.com/MIGRATION/)

*After usage instructions and the roadmap, we enumerate all changes from `v0.3.3`.*

### Using Release `v0.4.0`

Unlike pre-releases, `v0.4.0` is a new semver minor release for the theme. That means that users who have not pinned the theme version will be **automatically upgraded to `v0.4.0` the next time they build their site**.

To use this release explicitly as a remote theme:

```yml
remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.4.0
```

To use this RC explicitly as a gem-based theme, pin the version in your `Gemfile` and re-run `bundle install` or `bundle update just-the-docs`:

```ruby
gem "just-the-docs", "0.4.0"
```

If you would prefer to not upgrade, you can enforce that explicitly:

1. pin your gem version in your `Gemfile`, like so
```ruby
gem "just-the-docs", "0.3.3"
```
2. freeze the `remote_theme`, like so
```yml
remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.3.3
```

### Migration Guide and Strategies

We've developed a new [migration guide](https://just-the-docs.com/MIGRATION/) for users to migrate from version `v0.3.3` to `v0.4.0`. It outlines major changes in project maintenance (e.g. new repository link, team) as well as breaking changes that may break your site (and potential solutions). We suggest that all users refer to the guide before manually upgrading their site.

**For the vast majority of users, we do not anticipate that this will be a breaking change.** The major touch points are surrounding new includes, navigation (ordering, pages, and collections), the favicon, and a shift to relative URLs. However, users who heavily customize the theme (primarily by overriding includes) will likely have to make minor changes.

Given the length of features added in this release, users may want to incrementally upgrade through the pre-releases. To follow this approach, read this changelog from `v0.4.0.rc1` to `v0.4.0.rc5`; this breaks down the release into small chunks, each of which should be easier to upgrade. `v0.4.0.rc5` is identical to this release.

For support with migrating to `v0.4.0`, [open an issue](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs/issues) or [start a discussion](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs/discussions) and let us know!

### Roadmap (What's Next?)

Moving forward, we plan to release more frequently with smaller, bite-sized changes. This should make it easier for users to upgrade in the future!

Broadly, many features are still on the radar. We anticipate the rest of `v0.4.x` to be bugfixes surrounding this new release.

For version `v0.5`, our roadmap includes:

- a theme toggle (light/dark mode), with automatic theme switching based on browser preferences
- better GDPR compliance for analytics
- multi-level/recursive navigation (unlimited hierarchy of child pages)

In future versions, we also plan on:

- adding better dark theme defaults
- adding better internationalization support
- exploring offline PDF generation
- improving accessibility within the theme
- improving search functionality
- refactoring and improving the robustness of our codebase

Have ideas for what's next, or want to get involved? [Open an issue](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs/issues) or [start a discussion](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs/discussions) and let us know! We're looking for more contributors and maintainers to help us develop the theme.
